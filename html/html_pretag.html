                                                     "Itsy bitsy spider"




                                                                    Itsy bitsy spider
                                                                    Climbed up the waterspout;
                                                                    Down came the rain
                                                                    And washed the spider out;
                                                                    Out came the sun
                                                                    And dried up all the rain;
                                                                    And the itsy bitsy spider
                                                                   Climbed up the spout again.
