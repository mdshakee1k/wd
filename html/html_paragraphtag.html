<!--Hi htsdsml is very cool to learn-->
<p>
What is the difference between Git stash apply andGit stash pop?<br>
Ans.The 'Git stash apply and 'Git stash pop'commsnds are used when you have to reapply the stashed changes and start working from where you left.
<br>
<br>
The difference between them is that while the 'Git stash apply' command keeps the changees in the stashlist for later use, the 'Git stash pop' command removes the changes from the stash after applying it.
